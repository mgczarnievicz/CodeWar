[Ordered Count of Characters](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a6633153ba33189e000074/)

### Level: 7 kyu

## DESCRIPTION:

Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a (list of tuples) in order of appearance. For empty output return (an empty list).

Consult the solution set-up for the exact data structure implementation depending on your language.

Example:

```js
orderedCount("abracadabra") ==
    [
        ["a", 5],
        ["b", 2],
        ["r", 2],
        ["c", 1],
        ["d", 1],
    ];
```
